        "There is much more to creating a program than writing code. In ISYS5002, we followed a six-step problem solving methodology cycle. Demonstrate the first four steps of the problem solving methodology cycle by **designing** an application that calculates the net amount payable for items purchased at a store. The store offers a `10%` discount if the total purchase value is more than or equal to `$200` and additional `15%` on purchase amounts exceeding $1000. The app should input price of each item purchased, calculate total purchase values, the amount of discount applicable and the net amount payable by the customer and display the results. \n",
